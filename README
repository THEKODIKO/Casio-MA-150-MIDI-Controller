<Utility Buttons Board>
 - To be easier on eyes the picture for the utility buttons board has been divided into 2 parts A and B with each button numbered and the diodes already have been numbered from the factory (see the back side of the pcb).
 - The numbering in the images and the schematic are the same (both for buttons and diode).
